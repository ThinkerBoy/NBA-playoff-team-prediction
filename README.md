# NBA Playoff Team Preditive Feature Analysis
FA18 Data Science Project

Team Member: Matthew Gregory, Olivia Roy, Francis Schickel, Tina Wu 
 
Overview:

The NBA playoffs provide a marker of the best eight teams in each division after the regular season. The goal of the regular season is making the playoffs; teams trade players, extend contracts, and invest heavily in order to achieve this goal. Player statistics, franchise data, and a variety of other unique factors seem to help predict whether a team will successfully make the playoffs. We plan on creating a statistical model to predict which teams will make the playoffs using said factors from the previous year. Specifically, we are interested in which features have the most weight in accurately predicting if a team will make playoffs. We plan on testing multiple models that include different combinations of features in order to determine the predictive factors most essential to predicting a teamâ€™s success in making the NBA playoffs.


Data Source:

The main source that will be used is NBA Stats (https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1). This dataset shows both player and team data, such as points, rebounds, and assists per game as well as other advanced statistics such as clutch wins, fast break points per game, and percentage of points in the paint. Other categories for statistics to be analyzed are by playtype (isolation, post up, etc), hustle, and opponent shooting. Other non-game based statistics used will surround salary cap, draft picks, attendance and other franchise data. Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/salary-cap-history.html) and ESPN (http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance) will be used for those statistics.
